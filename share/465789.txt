自我介绍
A master student majoring in HCI at the University of Melbourne. This is my second semester. I like reading and traveling. To chat with different people, to visit different countries. My last internship was in Singapore. I pretty like that job. 

为什么选择HUJI
1. It is a famous university in the world.TIP program is very attractive to me. The program introduce that it can provide me with pieces of training of what I want to learn — helping me to understand advanced technologies, most common business models, learning how to generate new ideas, handling real-world problems and how to transform ideas into a business product. In the future, I believe that these knowledge I learnt in HUJI gonna help me a lot.
2.Israel is a historical country and there are lots of technology companies. I would like to learn more about it. And TIP program gives me that chance. This is different from traveling around in the Israel. Traveling is through the beautiful landscapes to know the place. But through educational program, not only I could talk with the local, but also could talk with different people from other countries see what's their opinion about the Jerusalem.
